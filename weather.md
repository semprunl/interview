Weather Observations
--------------------

Build a tool to mine the logs of a weather balloon for important
information - please use Spring Boot to do so.

#### Requirements

There is a weather balloon traversing the globe, periodically taking
observations. At each observation, the balloon records the temperature
and its current location. When possible, the balloon relays this data
back to observation posts on the ground.

A log line returned from the weather balloon looks something like this:

```
2014-12-31T13:44|10,5|243|AU
```

More formally this is:

```
<timestamp>|<location>|<temperature>|<observatory>
```

Where the `timestamp` is `yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm` in UTC.

Where the `location` is a co-ordinate `x,y`. And x, and y are natural numbers in observatory specific units.

Where the `temperature` is an integer representing temperature in observatory specific units.

Where the `observatory` is a code indicating where the measurements were relayed from.

Data from the balloon is of varying quality, so don't make any
assumptions about the quality of the input.

Data from the balloon often comes in large batches, so assume you may
need to deal with data that doesn't fit in memory.

Data from the balloon does not necessarily arrive in order.

Unfortunately, units of measurement are dependent on the
observatory. The following is a lookup table for determining the
correct unit of measure:

| Observatory | Temperature | Distance |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| AU          | celsius     | km       |
| US          | fahrenheit  | miles    |
| FR          | kelvin      | m        |
| All Others  | kelvin      | km       |

We need a program (or set of programs) written in Java that can perform the following
tasks:

 1. Given that it is difficult to obtain real data from the weather
    balloon we would first like to be able to generate test data for use in simulation and
    testing. This producer service should be able to generate at least 1 million
    lines of data for testing your consumer (next steps). The service should add every line into a RabbitMQ queue.

 2. Create a consumer service which produces statistics of the flight. The program should be able to display the current information (at best in real time) (reading from the queue):

    - The minimum temperature.

    - The maximum temperature.

    - The mean temperature.

    - The number of observations from each observatory.

    - The total distance travelled.
    
    - Persist every line into a Postgres or h2 DB.
      
 3. Create a program which can display past information (see above) stored in the database - given a time range
   
#### Notes/Requirements

* Remember to use Spring Boot for your project
* Creating even a small test for your code will give you extra points
* Please use docker and send us a link to the public repo (Github, Gitlab, etc) - we love to read all your commits :)
* To output the data as requested on tasks #2 and #3 a simple command line output is enough - no HTML or anything fancy is required
* Please add a readme file explaining as much as possible your code and how can we execute it
